# webdev-talent-hub

Implement a landing page for a marketplace called Particles that connects companies with software developers. 

The page should have:
- A header with the Particles logo
- A main content area that explains the key value proposition, something like: "Particles is the best place to find and hire top software developers specializing in web technologies like React, Node, .NET, Go and JavaScript."
- A call-to-action button labeled "View Developer Listings" that links to /developers (this page doesn't need to exist yet)
- A footer with a simple copyright notice

Use a clean, professional design. The color scheme should be tech-focused, perhaps using blues and greens.
